Hello! Welcome to my website :)

I’m a hardware engineer at Apple, specializing in laser and optical measurements. My expertise extends to failure analysis and materials characterization, focusing on ensuring reliability in cutting-edge technologies—think of me as the magician who makes sure everything works just right behind the scenes.

When I’m not perfecting tech, I’m at home with my two adorable cats and my energetic baby boy, who keep life as entertaining as a rollercoaster ride. Thanks for stopping by!
