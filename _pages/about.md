Hello! Welcome to my website :)

Looking for a brilliant scientist who's pushing the boundaries of nanotechnology? Look no further than me! I'm a postdoctoral research scientist based at Lawrence Berkely National Laboratory, where I'm working on the cutting edge of machine learning-guided automated experimentation of nanomaterials.

With a PhD in Molecular Engineering from the University of Washington, Seattle, my research background spans laser cooling of materials and now, the intersection of AI and nanotechnology. I use robots to build tiny structures and push the limits of what's possible in the world of nanotech.

As a passionate advocate for science and innovation, I'm constantly looking for new ways to leverage technology to create new breakthroughs. Whether it's designing new experiments or analyzing data using advanced algorithms, I'm always exploring new frontiers and pushing the boundaries of what's possible.

So if you're looking for a scientist who's at the forefront of cutting-edge research, get in touch today!
