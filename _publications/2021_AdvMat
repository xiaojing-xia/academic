Abstract: This review focuses on the role point defects have played over the last two decades in realizing solid-state laser refrigeration. The review begins with a brief introduction to the field of solid-state laser refrigeration, with an emphasis on the fundamental physical phenomena and quantized electronic transitions that have made solid-state laser-cooling possible. Lanthanide-based point defects, such as trivalent ytterbium ions Yb^3+, have played a central role in the first demonstrations and subsequent development of advanced materials for solid-state laser refrigeration. Significant discussion is devoted to the quantum mechanical description of optical transitions in lanthanide ions, and their influence on laser cooling. Transition-metal point defects have been shown to generate substantial background absorption in ceramic materials, decreasing the overall efficiency of a particular laser refrigeration material. The review also contains a discussion of other potential color-centers based on fluoride vacancies with multiple potential charge states. The review concludes with a discussion of novel materials for solid-state laser refrigeration, including color centers in diamond that have recently been proposed to realize the solid-state laser refrigeration of semiconducting materials.
