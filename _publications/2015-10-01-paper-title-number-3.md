excerpt: 'Yb3+/Er3+ co-doped upconversion materials are widely used for luminescence intensity ratio (LIR) thermometry, where the relative intensity ratio of the green luminescence transitions (2H11/2 → 4I15/2 and 4S3/2 → 4I15/2) of Er3+ dopant ions changes with temperature. In this work we report on the impact of an additional transition from the 2H9/2 level to the intermediate 4I13/2 level, which overlaps with the green luminescence normally used for LIR thermometry. The 2H9/2 → 4I13/2 emission overlaps extensively with the 4S3/2 → 4I15/2 emission and is more sensitive to pump power. The wavelength intervals used to integrate both 2H11/2 → 4I15/2 and 4S3/2 → 4I15/2 luminescence need be selected carefully in order to achieve accurate temperature readouts.'
